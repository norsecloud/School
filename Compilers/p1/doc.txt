Basically my lexical anaylzer opens the .txt then reads it into a variable called lines
I then run a loop to seperater lines into individual single line. in that loop i run another loop
that reads each individual char. the char is put into letter then passed into a string. 
the string is finished when it reaches a specific char (space,  \n, etc) and then depending
on what the string says it responds accoringly.
